            <ul>

                    <h3>Overview</h3>
                    <p>During the tumultuous period of World War II, BOSE emerged as a bastion of resilience. It became
                        a crucible of skill and expertise, training a legion of technicians. Such was its importance
                        that even Lord Wavell, the Viceroy of India at the time, made fervent visits.

                        From its humble origins, with an initial intake capacity of a mere forty students in the Diploma
                        in Civil Engineering program, BOSE has burgeoned into a sprawling institution of learning.
                        Today, it offers diplomas in a diverse array of engineering disciplines, including Civil,
                        Mechanical, Electrical, Electronics and Telecommunication, and many others, totaling eleven
                        disciplines in all. With a cumulative intake capacity of 738 students annually, BOSE has evolved
                        into a bustling hive of intellectual activity, boasting a student body exceeding 2200.

                        Noteworthy advancements mark BOSE’s journey into the contemporary era. The institution has
                        garnered accolades such as accreditation from the National Board of Accreditation (NBA) in three
                        disciplines, a testament to its unwavering commitment to excellence. Furthermore, strategic
                        partnerships with industry giants like FESTO, Schneider Electric, and Philips Education
                        underscore BOSE’s forward-looking approach, aimed at fostering innovation and practical learning
                        experiences.

                        The graduates of BOSE, true to their alma mater’s ethos, have carved illustrious paths in
                        various domains. They adorn academia, occupying esteemed positions in institutions like the
                        IITs, NITs, and other premier engineering colleges. Moreover, they lend their expertise to the
                        public and private sectors, serving in organizations such as the Railways, SAIL, L&T, Infosys,
                        and a myriad of others. Noteworthy are their triumphs in skill competitions, where they have
                        consistently showcased their prowess and brought laurels to the institution.

                        Despite its illustrious past and present achievements, BOSE’s journey has not been devoid of
                        challenges. Efforts to elevate it to the status of a degree-granting institution have been made
                        in the past, albeit with elusive success. Yet, undeterred by setbacks, BOSE remains resolute in
                        its pursuit of excellence, guided by the enduring legacy of its founders and the indomitable
                        spirit of its students and faculty alike.</p>
